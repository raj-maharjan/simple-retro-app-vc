# Auto-Expiration Setup - Simple Solution

## Problem Fixed ‚úÖ
Previously, meetings only auto-expired when users were actively using the web app. If no one visited the app, meetings would stay active indefinitely.

## Simple Solution Implemented
We've implemented a **client-side auto-expiration system** that works immediately without any additional setup or costs.

## How It Works Now

### 1. **App Startup Check**
- When **anyone** visits your app, it immediately checks for expired meetings
- Runs even before users log in
- Catches meetings that expired while the app was offline

### 2. **User Login Check**
- When a user logs in, it runs another auto-expire check
- Ensures fresh state for each user session

### 3. **Periodic Monitoring**
- Checks every 30 seconds while users are active
- Monitors **all meetings** system-wide, not just the current user's

### 4. **Broader Coverage**
- Now checks all meetings in the system, not just the current user's meetings
- More reliable detection of expired meetings

## What Changed in the Code

### Dashboard.tsx
```typescript
// Before: Only checked current user's meetings
.eq('created_by', user.id)

// After: Checks ALL meetings system-wide
// (removed the user restriction)

// Before: Checked every 60 seconds
setInterval(checkExpiredMeetings, 60000)

// After: Checks every 30 seconds
setInterval(checkExpiredMeetings, 30000)
```

### App.tsx
```typescript
// New: App startup check
const checkExpiredMeetingsOnStartup = async () => {
  // Finds and auto-expires meetings older than 2 hours
  // Runs when app starts, even before login
}
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Free** - No additional costs or subscriptions required
‚úÖ **Immediate** - Works right away, no setup needed
‚úÖ **Better Coverage** - Checks all meetings, not just user's own
‚úÖ **Startup Resilience** - Catches meetings that expired while app was offline
‚úÖ **More Frequent** - Checks every 30 seconds when users are active

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. **View the Logs**
Open your browser console and look for logs like:
```
üöÄ App startup: Checking for expired meetings...
üîç Checking for meetings created before: [timestamp]
‚è∞ App startup: Found X expired meetings, auto-ending them...
‚úÖ Auto-ended meeting ABC123
```

### 2. **Test with a Meeting**
1. Create a test meeting
2. In your database, manually age it:
   ```sql
   UPDATE meetings 
   SET created_at = now() - interval '3 hours' 
   WHERE meeting_code = 'YOUR_TEST_CODE';
   ```
3. Refresh your app - it should auto-expire immediately

### 3. **Monitor Auto-Expiration**
The system logs all auto-expired meetings:
```
‚úÖ App startup: Found 2 expired meetings, auto-ending them...
üìù Auto-ending meeting: Sprint 23 Retro (ABC123)
‚úÖ Auto-ended meeting ABC123
```

## Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires App Visits** - Someone needs to visit your app for the auto-expiration to run
‚ö†Ô∏è **No Email Notifications** - This simple solution doesn't send summary emails when meetings auto-expire

## How Often Should People Visit?

For most teams, this works great because:
- Team members typically check the app daily
- Meetings are usually reviewed within 24-48 hours
- The 2-hour auto-expiration gives enough time for active retrospectives

## Monitoring

To see recently auto-expired meetings, you can check your database:
```sql
SELECT 
  id, title, meeting_code, created_at, ended_at
FROM meetings 
WHERE status = 'ended' 
  AND ended_by IS NULL  -- NULL means auto-expired
ORDER BY ended_at DESC;
```

## Success!

Your auto-expiration system is now working! üéâ

Meetings will automatically expire after 2 hours whenever someone visits your app, ensuring your system stays clean and efficient without any ongoing maintenance or costs.
